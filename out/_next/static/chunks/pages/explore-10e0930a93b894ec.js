I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\nof my undertaking.\n\n\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this\nfeeling?  This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\nand vivid.

What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?

I\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.",href:"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm",icon:"",title:"Frankenstein, by Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley | \nFrankenstein;\n"},{description:"A preface to the first edition of \u201cJane Eyre\u201d being unnecessary, I gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.",href:"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1260/1260-h/1260-h.htm",title:"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bront\xeb\n",icon:""},{description:"You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.
