She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple.\nSwift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of Speak Now. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down, and Swift shared some of the original lyrics in a deluxe edition of her 2019 album, Lover.",

Dylan Matthew, who appeared on tracks like 2018’s “Hate Being Alone”, supplies ethereal vocals, while Scott and Derek segue seamlessly from a siren-heavy, dubstep build to wispy, uplifting future bass.\nThe track is the duo’s first to have a full-length music video, created in collaboration with 3D-rendering artist Roboto, and appears on the first compilation of SLANDER and NGHTMRE’s label Gud Vibrations.",
